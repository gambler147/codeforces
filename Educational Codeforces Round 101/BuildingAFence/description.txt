You want to build a fence that will consist of 𝑛 equal sections. All sections
have a width equal to 1 and height equal to 𝑘. You will place all sections in
one line side by side.

Unfortunately, the ground beneath the fence is not flat. For simplicity, you can
think that the ground level under the 𝑖-th section is equal to ℎ𝑖.

You should follow several rules to build the fence:

the consecutive sections should have a common side of length at least 1; the
first and the last sections should stand on the corresponding ground levels; the
sections between may be either on the ground level or higher, but not higher
than 𝑘−1 from the ground level ℎ𝑖 (the height should be an integer); One of
possible fences (blue color) for the first test case Is it possible to build a
fence that meets all rules?

Input The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑘 (2≤𝑛≤2⋅105;
2≤𝑘≤108) — the number of sections in the fence and the height of each section.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers ℎ1,ℎ2,…,ℎ𝑛 (0≤ℎ𝑖≤108),
where ℎ𝑖 is the ground level beneath the 𝑖-th section.

It's guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.

Output For each test case print YES if it's possible to build the fence that
meets all rules. Otherwise, print NO.

You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all
be recognized as positive answer).
