Monocarp had a sequence 𝑎 consisting of 𝑛+𝑚 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛+𝑚. He
painted the elements into two colors, red and blue; 𝑛 elements were painted
red, all other 𝑚 elements were painted blue.

After painting the elements, he has written two sequences 𝑟1,𝑟2,…,𝑟𝑛 and
𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑚. The sequence 𝑟 consisted of all red elements of 𝑎 in the order
they appeared in 𝑎; similarly, the sequence 𝑏 consisted of all blue elements
of 𝑎 in the order they appeared in 𝑎 as well.

Unfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the
sequences 𝑟 and 𝑏. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there
are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that
maximizes the value of

𝑓(𝑎)=max(0,𝑎1,(𝑎1+𝑎2),(𝑎1+𝑎2+𝑎3),…,(𝑎1+𝑎2+𝑎3+⋯+𝑎𝑛+𝑚)) Help
Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of 𝑓(𝑎).

Input The first line contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test
cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of four lines.

The first line of each test case contains one integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤100).

The second line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑟1,𝑟2,…,𝑟𝑛 (−100≤𝑟𝑖≤100).

The third line contains one integer 𝑚 (1≤𝑚≤100).

The fourth line contains 𝑚 integers 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑚 (−100≤𝑏𝑖≤100).

Output For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible value of
𝑓(𝑎).
