A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct
arithmetic expression by inserting characters + and 1 into this sequence. For
example, sequences (())(), () and (()(())) are regular, while )(, (() and
(()))( are not. Let's call a regular bracket sequence "RBS".

You are given a sequence 𝑠 of 𝑛 characters (, ), and/or ?. There is exactly
one character ( and exactly one character ) in this sequence.

You have to replace every character ? with either ) or ( (different characters ?
can be replaced with different brackets). You cannot reorder the characters,
remove them, insert other characters, and each ? must be replaced.

Determine if it is possible to obtain an RBS after these replacements.

Input The first line contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing 𝑠 (2≤|𝑠|≤100) — a sequence of
characters (, ), and/or ?. There is exactly one character ( and exactly one
character ) in this sequence.

Output For each test case, print YES if it is possible to obtain a regular
bracket sequence, or NO otherwise}.

You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all
be recognized as positive answer).
