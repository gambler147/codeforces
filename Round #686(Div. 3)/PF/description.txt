You are given an array 𝑎 consisting of 𝑛 integers.

Let 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑙,𝑟) be the minimum value among 𝑎𝑙,𝑎𝑙+1,…,𝑎𝑟 and
𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑙,𝑟) be the maximum value among 𝑎𝑙,𝑎𝑙+1,…,𝑎𝑟.

Your task is to choose three positive (greater than 0) integers 𝑥, 𝑦 and 𝑧
such that:

𝑥+𝑦+𝑧=𝑛; 𝑚𝑎𝑥(1,𝑥)=𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥+1,𝑥+𝑦)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥+𝑦+1,𝑛). In other words,
you have to split the array 𝑎 into three consecutive non-empty parts that cover
the whole array and the maximum in the first part equals the minimum in the
second part and equals the maximum in the third part (or determine it is
impossible to find such a partition).

Among all such triples (partitions), you can choose any.

You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.

Input The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤2⋅104) — the
number of test cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer 𝑛 (3≤𝑛≤2⋅105) — the
length of 𝑎.

The second line of the test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
(1≤𝑎𝑖≤109), where 𝑎𝑖 is the 𝑖-th element of 𝑎.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 does not exceed 2⋅105 (∑𝑛≤2⋅105).

Output For each test case, print the answer: NO in the only line if there is no
such partition of 𝑎 that satisfies the conditions from the problem statement.
Otherwise, print YES in the first line and three integers 𝑥, 𝑦 and 𝑧
(𝑥+𝑦+𝑧=𝑛) in the second line.

If there are several answers, you can print any.
