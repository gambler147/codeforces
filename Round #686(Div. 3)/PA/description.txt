Special permutation

You are given one integer 𝑛 (𝑛>1).

Recall that a permutation of length 𝑛 is an array consisting of 𝑛 distinct
integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation of length 5, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in
the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (𝑛=3 but there is 4 in the
array).

Your task is to find a permutation 𝑝 of length 𝑛 that there is no index 𝑖
(1≤𝑖≤𝑛) such that 𝑝𝑖=𝑖 (so, for all 𝑖 from 1 to 𝑛 the condition 𝑝𝑖≠𝑖
should be satisfied).

You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.

If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the
answer exists for each 𝑛>1.

Input The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100) — the
number of test cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤100) — the length
of the permutation you have to find.

Output For each test case, print 𝑛 distinct integers 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛 — a
permutation that there is no index 𝑖 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛) such that 𝑝𝑖=𝑖 (so, for all
𝑖 from 1 to 𝑛 the condition 𝑝𝑖≠𝑖 should be satisfied).

If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the
answer exists for each 𝑛>1.
