You are given an integer 𝑛 (𝑛>1).

Your task is to find a sequence of integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑘 such that:

each 𝑎𝑖 is strictly greater than 1; 𝑎1⋅𝑎2⋅…⋅𝑎𝑘=𝑛 (i. e. the product of
this sequence is 𝑛); 𝑎𝑖+1 is divisible by 𝑎𝑖 for each 𝑖 from 1 to 𝑘−1; 𝑘
is the maximum possible (i. e. the length of this sequence is the maximum
possible). If there are several such sequences, any of them is acceptable. It
can be proven that at least one valid sequence always exists for any integer
𝑛>1.

You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.

Input The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤5000) — the
number of test cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤1010).

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 does not exceed 1010 (∑𝑛≤1010).

Output For each test case, print the answer: in the first line, print one
positive integer 𝑘 — the maximum possible length of 𝑎. In the second line,
print 𝑘 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑘 — the sequence of length 𝑘 satisfying the
conditions from the problem statement.

If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that at least
one valid sequence always exists for any integer 𝑛>1.
