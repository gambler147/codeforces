Unique bid auction

There is a game called "Unique Bid Auction". You can read more about it here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_bid_auction (though you don't have to do it
to solve this problem).

Let's simplify this game a bit. Formally, there are 𝑛 participants, the 𝑖-th
participant chose the number 𝑎𝑖. The winner of the game is such a participant
that the number he chose is unique (i. e. nobody else chose this number except
him) and is minimal (i. e. among all unique values of 𝑎 the minimum one is the
winning one).

Your task is to find the index of the participant who won the game (or -1 if
there is no winner). Indexing is 1-based, i. e. the participants are numbered
from 1 to 𝑛.

You have to answer 𝑡 independent test cases.

Input The first line of the input contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤2⋅104) — the
number of test cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅105) — the
number of participants. The second line of the test case contains 𝑛 integers
𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤𝑛), where 𝑎𝑖 is the 𝑖-th participant chosen number.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 does not exceed 2⋅105 (∑𝑛≤2⋅105).

Output For each test case, print the answer — the index of the participant who
won the game (or -1 if there is no winner). Note that the answer is always
unique.
