Identify the Operations

We start with a permutation 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 and with an empty array 𝑏. We apply
the following operation 𝑘 times.

On the 𝑖-th iteration, we select an index 𝑡𝑖 (1≤𝑡𝑖≤𝑛−𝑖+1), remove 𝑎𝑡𝑖
from the array, and append one of the numbers 𝑎𝑡𝑖−1 or 𝑎𝑡𝑖+1 (if 𝑡𝑖−1 or
𝑡𝑖+1 are within the array bounds) to the right end of the array 𝑏. Then we
move elements 𝑎𝑡𝑖+1,…,𝑎𝑛 to the left in order to fill in the empty space.

You are given the initial permutation 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 and the resulting array
𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑘. All elements of an array 𝑏 are distinct. Calculate the number
of possible sequences of indices 𝑡1,𝑡2,…,𝑡𝑘 modulo 998244353.

Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100000), denoting the number of test cases, followed by a description
of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛,𝑘 (1≤𝑘<𝑛≤200000):
sizes of arrays 𝑎 and 𝑏.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
(1≤𝑎𝑖≤𝑛): elements of 𝑎. All elements of 𝑎 are distinct.

The third line of each test case contains 𝑘 integers 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑘
(1≤𝑏𝑖≤𝑛): elements of 𝑏. All elements of 𝑏 are distinct.

The sum of all 𝑛 among all test cases is guaranteed to not exceed 200000.

Output For each test case print one integer: the number of possible sequences
modulo 998244353.
