Long permutation

A permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to 𝑛 of length 𝑛 containing
each number exactly once. For example, [1], [4,3,5,1,2], [3,2,1] — are
permutations, and [1,1], [4,3,1], [2,3,4] — no.

Permutation 𝑎 is lexicographically smaller than permutation 𝑏 (they have the
same length 𝑛), if in the first index 𝑖 in which they differ, 𝑎[𝑖]<𝑏[𝑖].
For example, the permutation [1,3,2,4] is lexicographically smaller than the
permutation [1,3,4,2], because the first two elements are equal, and the third
element in the first permutation is smaller than in the second.

The next permutation for a permutation 𝑎 of length 𝑛 — is the
lexicographically smallest permutation 𝑏 of length 𝑛 that lexicographically
larger than 𝑎. For example:

for permutation [2,1,4,3] the next permutation is [2,3,1,4]; for permutation
[1,2,3] the next permutation is [1,3,2]; for permutation [2,1] next permutation
does not exist. You are given the number 𝑛 — the length of the initial
permutation. The initial permutation has the form 𝑎=[1,2,…,𝑛]. In other words,
𝑎[𝑖]=𝑖 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛).

You need to process 𝑞 queries of two types:

1 𝑙 𝑟: query for the sum of all elements on the segment [𝑙,𝑟]. More
formally, you need to find 𝑎[𝑙]+𝑎[𝑙+1]+…+𝑎[𝑟]. 2 𝑥: 𝑥 times replace the
current permutation with the next permutation. For example, if 𝑥=2 and the
current permutation has the form [1,3,4,2], then we should perform such a chain
of replacements [1,3,4,2]→[1,4,2,3]→[1,4,3,2]. For each query of the 1-st type
output the required sum.

Input The first line contains two integers 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤2⋅105) and 𝑞 (1≤𝑞≤2⋅105),
where 𝑛 — the length of the initial permutation, and 𝑞 — the number of
queries.

The next 𝑞 lines contain a single query of the 1-st or 2-nd type. The 1-st type
query consists of three integers 1, 𝑙 and 𝑟 (1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛), the 2-nd type query
consists of two integers 2 and 𝑥 (1≤𝑥≤105).

It is guaranteed that all requests of the 2-nd type are possible to process.

Output For each query of the 1-st type, output on a separate line one integer —
the required sum.

Example inputCopy 4 4 1 2 4 2 3 1 1 2 1 3 4 outputCopy 9 4 6 Note Initially, the
permutation has the form [1,2,3,4]. Queries processing is as follows:

2+3+4=9; [1,2,3,4]→[1,2,4,3]→[1,3,2,4]→[1,3,4,2]; 1+3=4; 4+2=6
