Kids Seating

Today the kindergarten has a new group of 𝑛 kids who need to be seated at the
dinner table. The chairs at the table are numbered from 1 to 4𝑛. Two kids can't
sit on the same chair. It is known that two kids who sit on chairs with numbers
𝑎 and 𝑏 (𝑎≠𝑏) will indulge if:

𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑎,𝑏)=1 or, 𝑎 divides 𝑏 or 𝑏 divides 𝑎. 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑎,𝑏) — the maximum
number 𝑥 such that 𝑎 is divisible by 𝑥 and 𝑏 is divisible by 𝑥.

For example, if 𝑛=3 and the kids sit on chairs with numbers 2, 3, 4, then they
will indulge since 4 is divided by 2 and 𝑔𝑐𝑑(2,3)=1. If kids sit on chairs
with numbers 4, 6, 10, then they will not indulge.

The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the
kids so there are no 2 of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no
pair of chairs 𝑎 and 𝑏 that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above.

Since the teacher is very busy with the entertainment of the kids, she asked you
to solve this problem.

Input The first line contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100) — the number of test
cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing an integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤100) — the
number of kids.

Output Output 𝑡 lines, which contain 𝑛 distinct integers from 1 to 4𝑛 — the
numbers of chairs that the kids should occupy in the corresponding test case. If
there are multiple answers, print any of them. You can print 𝑛 numbers in any
order.
